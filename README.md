# MMLTracker

Back in 2011, I thought I'd write an editor for [MML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language). I didn't get far before life got in the way. The history of the project, such as it is, is documented here: http://mml-tracker.blogspot.com/

The source code sat on Google Code for four years. Now that Google Code is shutting down, this is mml-tracker's new home.

I may pick this project up again someday, but it's unlikely. If anyone wants to pick up the ball and run with it, go right ahead; I look forward to your pull requests.
